# Primeiro_site
This is where I'll store most of the code so that it can go on main later. For now, it comprises of the back-end application that users can add names, CPF and RG (brazilian
ID numbers), phone and other information about other users. Since it's my first back-end project it will be pretty basic.

Now, I will also like to add a log-in and user registration process with JWTs and append them (and the log-in, sign up and registration html pages) to the actual website
where once you establish a user, it redirects you to the actual website.
